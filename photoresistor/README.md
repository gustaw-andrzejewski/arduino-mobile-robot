# Light-Seeking Robot

## Overview
This mode allows the robot to follow the brightest light source using **photoresistors**.  
The robot adjusts its movement based on differences in light intensity detected by two sensors.

## Notes
- You can adjust the **sensitivity threshold** by modifying `LIGHT_THRESHOLD` in the code.
- The robot signals initialization using **LED flashes and buzzer beeps** before movement.
