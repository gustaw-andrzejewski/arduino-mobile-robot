# Line Follower Robot

## Overview
This mode enables the robot to follow a black line on a white surface using **infrared sensors**.  
The robot adjusts its movement based on sensor readings to stay on track.

## Notes
- You can adjust the **sensitivity threshold** by modifying the `BORDERLINE` value.
- The robot makes small adjustments by turning slightly left or right when detecting a line.
