# Obstacle Detection Robot (Mechanical Sensors)

## Overview
This mode allows the robot to detect obstacles using **mechanical limit switches**.  
When a collision is detected, the robot stops, moves backward, and turns to avoid the obstacle.  

## Demonstration

## Notes
- The buzzer **activates when an obstacle is detected**.
- You can adjust turning duration by modifying the `randomTurnTime` value.
