# IR Remote-Controlled Robot

## Overview
This mode allows the robot to be controlled using an **infrared remote**.  
It responds to directional commands and speed adjustments based on the IR signal received.

## Notes
- Speed increases when holding a button, then resets after reaching the maximum.
- You can modify button mappings in the `#define BUTTON_*` section of the code.
